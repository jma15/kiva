If you have any problems compiling or installing the program, please feel free to contact me.

There are three files with this assignment
loan.py				Main file to request data from Kiva Api
loan_class.py 		Classes to help store data in an easy format
requirements.txt	File with dependencies to install for python library
README				File to provide instructions, notes and explanation
loan_test.py 		File to verify script, class functions and calculations are correct

Assumptions:
1. We want to use local timezone for the script to run
2. Assume we dont need to care about over funded loans (funded_amount > loans_amount)
3. If there is an Error (invalid query or incorrect parameter), exit the script with exit code 2

Objective:
1. Filter: for loans that have a status of 'fundRaising' and 'PlannedExpirationDate' in the next 24 hours
2. Determine the total dollar amount it would take to fund all of these loans
3. Show also a link to each loan and the amount it has left to fundraise.

Instructions:
	We will need python for this. Please install python version Python 2.7.10. I believe this will work with other version.

	Install python:
		Linux: apt-get install python2.7
		Mac: https://www.python.org/downloads/

	Install pip:
		Mac: sudo easy_install pip

	After installing python and pip, we can code in python.
	However, we will need to install the dependency for this script:
		pip install -r requirements.txt 

	Now we should be ready to run and test the script.

Compile (Script):
	To compile with current default time.
    	python loan.py
    
    To compile with a specific datetime. 
    This will allow flexibility incase there is no result for the next 24 hours of current time.
        python loan.py -d 'YEAR-MONTH-DAY HOUR:MINUTE:SEC'
    
    Example:
        python loan.py -d '2017-09-08 23:44:30'

Compile (Unit Test):
	Run the unit test to verify the script is working
		python loan_test.py -v

	Example Unit Test Output:
